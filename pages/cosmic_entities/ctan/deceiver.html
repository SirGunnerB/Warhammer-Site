                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>The Deceiver, known as Mephet'ran to the Necrontyr, is among the most insidious of the C'tan. Unlike its more directly destructive kin, it prefers to work through subtle manipulation, earning its title through countless millennia of deception and betrayal. It was instrumental in convincing the Necrontyr to undergo biotransference, perhaps its greatest deception.</p>

                    <p>The Deceiver's influence extends over lies, manipulation, and trickery. It excels at exploiting desires and fears, turning truth into lies and allies into enemies through subtle corruption.</p>
