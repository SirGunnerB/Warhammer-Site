                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>The Outsider is perhaps the most enigmatic of all C'tan, driven to madness and exiled from the galaxy. Ancient texts speak of its insanity and the circumstances of its exile, though much remains shrouded in mystery. It is said to be imprisoned within a dyson sphere, eternally circling a dead star.</p>

                    <p>The Outsider's true form is largely unknown, but it is described in ancient texts as a being of impossible geometries and mind-shattering appearance. Those who have glimpsed it speak of a form that defies comprehension, constantly shifting between states of matter and void.</p>

                    <h3>Domain</h3>
                    <p>The Outsider's sphere of influence encompasses isolation, madness, and the spaces between reality. Its presence is said to drive mortal beings to insanity through its mere proximity.</p>

                    <h3>The Great Deception</h3>
                    <p>According to some accounts, the Outsider's madness was induced by the Deceiver, who tricked it into consuming other C'tan. This act of cannibalism against its own kind is said to have shattered its sanity.</p>

                    <h3>The Exile</h3>
                    <p>Following its descent into madness, the Outsider was either driven or chose to exile itself from the galaxy. It now resides within a massive dyson sphere, though whether this is imprisonment or self-imposed isolation remains debated.</p>
