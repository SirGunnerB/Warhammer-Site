                    <p>The Emperor of Mankind is the immortal ruling monarch of the Imperium of Man, and is described by the Imperial Ecclesiarchy as the Father, Guardian and God of humanity. He has sat immobile, his body slowly crumbling, within the Golden Throne of Terra for over 10,000 years.</p>
                </div>

                <h2>Origins</h2>
                <p>The Emperor's origins are shrouded in mystery. According to ancient legends, he was born in the 8th millennium BCE in ancient central Anatolia. He was the collective reincarnation of ancient human shamans who had possessed vast psychic powers. Throughout human history, the Emperor guided humanity from the shadows, taking on many names and identities.</p>

                <h2>The Great Crusade</h2>
                <p>After the Age of Strife, the Emperor revealed himself to humanity in the 30th millennium. He united Terra through the Unification Wars and launched the Great Crusade to reconquer humanity's lost colonies. During this time, he created the Primarchs, twenty superhuman sons, and from their genetic material, he created the Space Marine Legions.</p>

                <h2>The Golden Age</h2>
                <p>Under the Emperor's direct leadership, humanity experienced a brief renaissance. He established the Imperial Truth, a secular doctrine based on reason and science. The Emperor sought to unite humanity and guide them into a psychic species while protecting them from the dangers of Chaos.</p>

                <h2>The Horus Heresy</h2>
                <p>The Emperor's dream was shattered when his favored son, Horus, turned against him. The resulting civil war, known as the Horus Heresy, culminated in a final battle aboard Horus's flagship. Though the Emperor defeated Horus, he was mortally wounded and has remained interred in the Golden Throne ever since.</p>

                <h2>The Present</h2>
                <p>For ten thousand years, the Emperor has existed in a state between life and death, sustained by the Golden Throne and the daily sacrifice of thousands of psykers. His psychic might maintains the Astronomican, allowing for warp travel across the Imperium, while his presence in the warp holds back the forces of Chaos.</p>
