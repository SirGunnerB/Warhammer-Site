                    <p>The Warp, also known as the Immaterium, the Empyrean, or the Sea of Souls, is an alternate dimension of psychic energy that underlies the material universe. It is a realm of pure chaos and unlimited potential, home to beings of pure energy and thought, and the source of all psychic phenomena in the galaxy.</p>
                </div>

                <h2>Nature of the Warp</h2>
                <p>Unlike the material universe, the Warp has no physical laws or constants. Time and space have no meaning there, and reality shifts constantly according to the emotions and thoughts of sentient beings in the material universe. The Warp is both created by and influences the collective psyche of all living things.</p>

                <h2>The Great Ocean</h2>
                <p>Often described as an ocean of pure psychic energy, the Warp's currents and tides are formed by the emotions and souls of all living beings. Just as an ocean can be calm or stormy, the Warp can range from relatively stable to violently turbulent, especially in areas where great violence or psychic activity occurs in the material realm.</p>

                <h2>Warp Travel</h2>
                <p>The Imperium relies on the Warp for faster-than-light travel. Ships equipped with Warp drives can enter the Immaterium and travel vast distances in relatively short periods. However, this form of travel is incredibly dangerous, requiring both Gellar Fields to protect ships from Warp entities and Navigators to guide them through the shifting tides of the Empyrean.</p>

                <h2>Psychic Powers</h2>
                <p>Psykers draw their power directly from the Warp, channeling its energies to perform what appears to be magic to the uninitiated. This connection makes them both incredibly powerful and dangerously vulnerable to possession by Warp entities. The Emperor's Astronomican, powered by his immense psychic might, provides a stable reference point for navigation through the Warp.</p>

                <h2>Inhabitants</h2>
                <p>The Warp is home to countless entities, from the smallest Warp predators to the mighty Chaos Gods themselves. Daemons, the most numerous of these entities, are manifestations of mortal emotions and desires given form and consciousness in the Immaterium. The most powerful of these beings can even manifest in realspace under certain conditions.</p>

                <h2>Dangers and Corruption</h2>
                <p>Exposure to the raw power of the Warp can corrupt both body and soul. This corruption can manifest in various ways, from subtle changes in behavior to grotesque physical mutations. The Imperium maintains strict protocols regarding Warp exposure and employs various technologies and rituals to protect against its influence.</p>
