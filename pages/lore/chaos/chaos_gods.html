                    <p>The Chaos Gods, also known as the Ruinous Powers, are immensely powerful and malevolent entities that inhabit and control the psychic dimension known as the Warp. Born from and sustained by the emotions and souls of all sentient beings, they are the greatest threat to the survival of humanity and all other races in the galaxy.</p>

                <h3>Khorne - The Blood God</h3>
                <p>The God of Blood, War, and Murder. Khorne embodies mindless and brutal violence, martial pride, and rage. His followers seek only to kill and destroy, caring not from where the blood flows, only that it does. His sacred number is 8, and his domain is violence and rage.</p>

                <h3>Tzeentch - The Changer of Ways</h3>
                <p>The God of Change, Evolution, and Sorcery. Tzeentch is the master of manipulation, scheming, and magical powers. His followers seek knowledge and power through arcane means. His sacred number is 9, and his domain is magic and deceit.</p>

                <h3>Nurgle - The Plague Lord</h3>
                <p>The God of Disease, Decay, and Rebirth. Nurgle represents entropy, pestilence, and the cycle of life and death. His followers embrace decay and spread disease. His sacred number is 7, and his domain is plague and corruption.</p>

                <h3>Slaanesh - The Prince of Pleasure</h3>
                <p>The God of Pleasure, Passion, and Excess. Slaanesh was born from the decadence of the Aeldari Empire. Their followers seek ever-greater sensations and experiences. Their sacred number is 6, and their domain is excess and sensation.</p>

                <h2>Nature of the Chaos Gods</h2>
                <p>The Chaos Gods are fundamentally tied to the emotions and actions of mortal beings. They are both a product of and a driving force behind the darkest aspects of mortal nature. Each feeds on specific emotions and behaviors, growing stronger as mortals indulge in their respective domains.</p>

                <h2>The Great Game</h2>
                <p>The Chaos Gods are locked in an eternal struggle known as the Great Game, each seeking to dominate the others while simultaneously preventing any single god from becoming too powerful. This conflict spills into the material universe through their mortal followers and daemon armies.</p>
