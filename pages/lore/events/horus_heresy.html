                <h2>Origins of Betrayal</h2>
                <p>Following the success of the Great Crusade, the Emperor returned to Terra to work on the secret Webway Project, leaving Horus Lupercal, his most trusted son, as Warmaster to lead the continuing expansion of the Imperium. This fateful decision, combined with growing dissatisfaction among some Primarchs, set the stage for the greatest betrayal in human history.</p>

                <h2>The Corruption of Horus</h2>
                <p>On the moon of Davin, Horus was mortally wounded and healed in a corrupted temple. During this time, the Chaos Gods showed him visions of a future where the Emperor was worshipped as a god - everything he and his father had fought against. These visions, though twisted by Chaos, convinced Horus that the Emperor had betrayed his own ideals.</p>

                <h2>The Civil War</h2>
                <p>The war began with the virus bombing of Isstvan III, where Horus purged loyal elements from the traitor legions. This was followed by the Drop Site Massacre on Isstvan V, where three loyal legions were almost completely destroyed by their betraying brothers. The galaxy burned as brother fought brother, with Space Marine fighting Space Marine and the Mechanicum tearing itself apart in the Schism of Mars.</p>

                <h2>The Siege of Terra</h2>
                <p>The culmination of the Heresy came with the Siege of Terra, where Horus's forces laid siege to the Imperial Palace itself. In the final battle aboard Horus's flagship, the Vengeful Spirit, the Emperor confronted his fallen son. Though the Emperor emerged victorious, he was mortally wounded and has remained interred in the Golden Throne for ten thousand years.</p>

                <h2>Legacy</h2>
                <p>The aftermath of the Heresy transformed the Imperium into the authoritarian, religious state it is in the 41st Millennium. The Emperor's dream of a secular human empire was replaced by the Imperial Cult, and the Traitor Legions were driven into the Eye of Terror, from where they continue to wage the Long War against the Imperium.</p>
