                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>The Imperial Knights are ancient houses of noble warriors who pilot towering mechanical walkers known as Knights. These Knights combine the martial pride of medieval nobility with advanced technology, serving as both protectors of their domains and powerful allies of the Imperium.</p>
                    <p>Each Knight House maintains its own traditions, heraldry, and codes of honor, dating back to the Dark Age of Technology. They are bound by ancient pacts to both the Imperium and the Adeptus Mechanicus, though they maintain their independence.</p>
                    <p>During the Age of Strife, Knight Houses served as protectors of human colonies, establishing a feudal culture that persists to this day. Their Knight suits, ancient technological marvels, are maintained through a combination of sacred rituals and technical expertise passed down through generations.</p>
                    <p>In battle, Knights operate either independently or in support of larger Imperial forces, where their presence can turn the tide of even the most desperate conflicts. Their martial prowess is legendary, with single Knights capable of defeating entire armies of lesser foes.</p>
