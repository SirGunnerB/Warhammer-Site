                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>The Sisters of Silence are an all-female order of Null-Maidens, warriors who possess the Pariah Gene that makes them invisible to and anathema to the Warp. They are among the most feared and respected warriors in the Imperium, specializing in hunting and eliminating psychic threats.</p>
                    <p>Though their numbers were greatly reduced after the Horus Heresy, they have recently returned to prominence following Guilliman's resurrection, working closely with the Adeptus Custodes in defending the Imperium.</p>
                    <p>Created during the Unification Wars by the Emperor himself, the Sisters of Silence were instrumental in maintaining control over psychic powers during humanity's expansion. Their presence was crucial in many campaigns where psychic threats needed to be neutralized, including the infamous Burning of Prospero.</p>
                    <p>In the modern era, they form part of the Talons of the Emperor alongside the Adeptus Custodes, serving as the Emperor's premier anti-psychic force. Their abilities are particularly vital in an age where psychic threats to the Imperium are growing ever stronger.</p>

                    <h3>Psychic Nullification</h3>
                    <p>Natural ability to nullify and disrupt psychic powers and Warp phenomena. Their presence creates a "silence" in the Warp, making it impossible for psykers to use their powers effectively. The strength of this ability varies among sisters, with some capable of completely shutting down even the most powerful psychic manifestations.</p>

                <div class="ability-card">
                    <h3>Warp Invisibility</h3>
                    <p>Undetectable by psychic means and resistant to Warp-based powers. This makes them perfect hunters of psychic entities and ideal for covert operations against psychic foes. Their presence in the Warp is described as a "void" or "absence" that can cause extreme discomfort to psychically sensitive beings.</p>

                <div class="ability-card">
                    <h3>Psychic Dampening</h3>
                    <p>Presence causes discomfort and disruption to psykers, weakening their connection to the Warp. In large numbers, Sisters can create zones of complete psychic nullification, making them invaluable in campaigns against Chaos forces or psychic xenos races.</p>

                <div class="ability-card">
                    <h3>Daemon Banishing</h3>
                    <p>Ability to weaken and banish Warp entities through their mere presence. Their null aura is particularly effective against daemon manifestations, making them crucial in defending against Chaos incursions. Some sisters can even permanently banish lesser daemons back to the Warp.</p>
