                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>The Officio Assassinorum is the Imperial organization responsible for training and deploying elite assassins. Operating from their hidden temples on Terra, they eliminate threats to the Imperium with surgical precision, whether those threats are political, military, or spiritual in nature.</p>
                    <p>Each temple specializes in a different method of assassination, creating operatives of unparalleled skill in their chosen art of death. The deployment of an Imperial Assassin requires the highest level of authorization, typically from the High Lords of Terra themselves.</p>
                    <p>Founded during the Great Crusade by Malcador the Sigillite, the Officio Assassinorum has served as the Emperor's hidden blade for over ten millennia. Their existence is known to few outside the highest echelons of Imperial power, and their actions have shaped the course of Imperial history countless times.</p>
                    <p>The organization maintains strict protocols and operates under the oversight of the Grand Master of Assassins, who answers directly to the High Lords of Terra. Each successful mission reinforces the Imperium's authority, while failed missions are purged from official records.</p>
