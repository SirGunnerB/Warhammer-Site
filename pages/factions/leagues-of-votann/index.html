                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>The Leagues of Votann are ancient civilizations of advanced abhumans, often called Kin, who dwell in mighty holds across the galaxy. They are the descendants of humanity who evolved separately in the depths of space, guided by their powerful Votann artificial intelligence systems.</p>
                    <p>Masters of technology and trade, the Leagues maintain vast commercial empires while defending their interests with advanced weaponry and clone armies. Their society revolves around the Votann cores, ancient computational matrices that store the accumulated knowledge of their civilization.</p>
                    <p>Unlike their Imperial cousins, the Kin have maintained much of their Dark Age of Technology heritage, though their Votann cores are showing signs of age and degradation. Their society combines ultra-advanced technology with deeply traditional values, creating a unique culture that values both innovation and tradition.</p>
                    <p>The Leagues maintain a pragmatic approach to galactic politics, trading with those who respect their interests and ruthlessly eliminating those who threaten them. Their superior technology and economic power make them formidable allies or dangerous enemies.</p>

                    <h3>The Votann</h3>
                    <p>Ancient AI systems that guide Kin civilization and store their accumulated knowledge. Each Votann core is unique, housing millennia of data and ancestral wisdom. However, many cores are showing signs of entropy, leading to slower response times and occasional errors in judgment.</p>
