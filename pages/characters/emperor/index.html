            <h2>History</h2>
            <h3>Ancient History</h3>
            <p>Born in ancient times in central Anatolia on Earth, the being who would become the Emperor was the collective reincarnation of thousands of ancient human shamans. Through millennia, He guided humanity from the shadows, taking different identities throughout human history.</p>

            <h3>The Great Crusade</h3>
            <p>In M30, He emerged to unite the warring nations of Terra, created the Space Marines and the Primarchs, and launched the Great Crusade to reunite humanity across the galaxy. This marked the beginning of the Imperium of Man.</p>

            <h3>The Horus Heresy</h3>
            <p>The Emperor's most favored son, Horus, betrayed him, leading to the devastating Horus Heresy. The conflict culminated in a final battle aboard Horus's flagship, where the Emperor was mortally wounded but succeeded in defeating Horus.</p>
