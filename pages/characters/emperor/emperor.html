                    <h3>The First Men</h3>
                    <p>Born around 8,000 BCE in ancient Anatolia, the being who would become the Emperor was the collective reincarnation of thousands of ancient human shamans. These psykers, foreseeing humanity's doom, performed a ritual of mass suicide to create a being of unprecedented psychic power.</p>

                    <p>During the Age of Strife, as human civilization collapsed, the Emperor remained hidden, gathering power and knowledge. He foresaw that humanity would need his direct intervention to survive the coming storms.</p>
