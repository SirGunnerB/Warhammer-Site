                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>Malcador the Sigillite was one of the Emperor's most trusted servants and the First Lord of Terra. A powerful psyker and skilled administrator, he was instrumental in building the foundations of the Imperium and sacrificed himself to protect the Emperor during the Siege of Terra. Known as the Hero of the Imperium, he was one of the most powerful psykers in human history and a master statesman who shaped the Imperium's bureaucratic and institutional foundations.</p>
                <p>His title "the Sigillite" came from his role as the keeper of rare artifacts and ancient knowledge from Terra's past, preserving humanity's history through the Age of Strife. His influence on the Imperium was so profound that many of the organizations he created continue to be cornerstones of Imperial governance in the 41st Millennium.</p>
