                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>Constantin Valdor was the first Captain-General of the Legio Custodes and one of the Emperor's most trusted warriors. Known as the "Emperor's Spear," he was arguably the greatest warrior in the Imperium after the Emperor and the Primarchs. His name became synonymous with martial excellence and unwavering loyalty, setting the standard for all Custodians who would follow.</p>
                <p>As the first among the Ten Thousand, Valdor's abilities were legendary even among his superhuman peers. His disappearance after the Horus Heresy remains one of the Imperium's greatest mysteries, though his legacy continues to influence the Adeptus Custodes in the 41st Millennium.</p>
