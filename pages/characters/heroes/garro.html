                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>Battle-Captain Nathaniel Garro was a former officer of the Death Guard Legion who became one of the first Knights-Errant. His actions during the early stages of the Horus Heresy proved crucial in warning the Emperor of Horus's betrayal. Known for his unwavering loyalty and dedication to the Imperial Truth, Garro's journey from Death Guard Battle-Captain to founding member of what would become the Grey Knights exemplifies the complex nature of loyalty during the Heresy.</p>
                <p>His most famous act was commanding the Eisenstein during its perilous journey to Terra, carrying warning of the Warmaster's betrayal. This action would mark him in Imperial history as one of the greatest heroes of the Horus Heresy, though his subsequent service as a Knight-Errant would prove equally vital to the Emperor's cause.</p>
