                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>Magnus the Red, the Crimson King, was the Primarch of the Thousand Sons Legion and is now a mighty Daemon Prince of Tzeentch. Blessed with immense psychic power and an insatiable thirst for knowledge, Magnus was perhaps the most intellectually gifted of all the Emperor's sons. His tragic fall from grace, sparked by his desperate attempt to warn the Emperor of Horus's betrayal, led to the destruction of his homeworld Prospero and his Legion's corruption by Chaos.</p>
                <p>As the most powerful psyker among the Primarchs, Magnus's abilities and pursuit of forbidden knowledge would ultimately prove to be both his greatest strength and his undoing. His actions during the Horus Heresy had far-reaching consequences for the Imperium, including the crippling of the Emperor's Webway Project.</p>

                <h2>Early Life</h2>
                <h3>Life on Prospero</h3>
                <p>Landing on the planet Prospero, Magnus was found by a society of psychic scholars who had fled persecution elsewhere in the galaxy. His massive size, crimson skin, and single eye marked him as unique even among the mutant psykers of Prospero. Under their tutelage, Magnus quickly mastered his immense psychic powers and eventually became the leader of Prospero's capital city, Tizca, the City of Light.</p>
                
                <h3>Meeting the Emperor</h3>
                <p>When the Emperor discovered Magnus, He found a son whose psychic powers rivaled His own. Magnus immediately recognized his father and embraced Imperial Truth, though he would continue to secretly pursue knowledge of the arcane. The Emperor shared much of his knowledge with Magnus, including information about the Webway Project, marking the beginning of a close but ultimately doomed relationship.</p>

                <h2>Great Crusade</h2>
                <h3>Leading the Thousand Sons</h3>
                <p>Magnus took command of the XV Legion, renamed the Thousand Sons, and reshaped them in his image. He cured the flesh-change that plagued his sons, though this "cure" would later prove to be a pact with Tzeentch. Under his leadership, the Legion became known for its scholarly pursuit of knowledge and mastery of psychic powers.</p>

                <h3>Council of Nikaea</h3>
                <p>The increasing use of psychic powers by the Thousand Sons led to suspicion and fear among their fellow Legions. At the Council of Nikaea, Magnus defended the use of psychic powers but was ultimately censured by the Emperor's decree. This decision would have devastating consequences when Magnus later chose to ignore the decree to warn the Emperor of Horus's betrayal.</p>

                <h2>The Horus Heresy</h2>
                <h3>The Warning and the Folly</h3>
                <p>Upon learning of Horus's betrayal through sorcerous means, Magnus attempted to psychically warn the Emperor. This act catastrophically breached the Imperial Webway Project's protections, flooding Terra's dungeons with daemons. The Emperor, enraged, dispatched Leman Russ to bring Magnus to Terra for judgment.</p>

                <h3>The Burning of Prospero</h3>
                <p>Through Horus's manipulation, Russ's censure became a death sentence. The Space Wolves attacked Prospero, destroying the planet and its civilization. In desperation, Magnus made a final pact with Tzeentch to save his sons, transforming them and himself into servants of Chaos. He would later join Horus's rebellion, though his true loyalty remained to the pursuit of knowledge rather than Horus's cause.</p>

                <h2>Legacy</h2>
                <p>Magnus's actions had profound consequences for the Imperium. His breach of the Imperial Webway Project forced the Emperor to remain bound to the Golden Throne, while his Legion's fall to Chaos created one of the most dangerous threats to the Imperium - a legion of powerful sorcerers led by a Daemon Primarch.</p>
                <p>As a Daemon Prince of Tzeentch, Magnus continues to scheme from his planet of sorcerers, the Planet of the Sorcerers, occasionally launching devastating attacks against the Imperium, particularly against his old enemies, the Space Wolves. His pursuit of knowledge and power remains unending, as does his bitterness towards the Imperium that rejected him.</p>
