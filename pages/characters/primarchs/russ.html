                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>Leman Russ, known as the Wolf King, was the Primarch of the Space Wolves Legion. Found on the death world of Fenris, he was raised by wolves before being adopted by its king. His savage nobility and uncompromising loyalty to the Emperor made him one of the most feared and respected of the Primarchs.</p>
                <p>Often referred to as the Emperor's Executioner, Russ and his Legion were called upon when other Space Marine Legions needed to be brought to heel, most notably during the Burning of Prospero. His disappearance into the Eye of Terror, vowing to return for the "Wolftime," remains one of the great mysteries of the Imperium.</p>

                <h2>Early Life</h2>
                <h3>Discovery on Fenris</h3>
                <p>Landing on the death world of Fenris, the infant Primarch was found and raised by a pack of Fenrisian Wolves. He was later discovered by King Thengir of the Russ tribe, who named him Leman of the Russ. His superhuman abilities and fierce nature quickly earned him the respect and leadership of the tribe.</p>
                
                <h3>Rise to Power</h3>
                <p>Within a short time, Leman Russ became King of the Russ and then unified all the tribes of Fenris through combat and force of personality. His legend grew until the Emperor arrived, challenging him to three contests which would cement their relationship as father and son.</p>

                <h2>Great Crusade</h2>
                <h3>Leading the Vlka Fenryka</h3>
                <p>Taking command of the VI Legion, Russ transformed them into the Space Wolves, instilling in them the warrior culture of Fenris. Under his leadership, they became known as one of the most effective and feared fighting forces in the Imperium, specializing in total warfare and compliance actions against other Space Marine Legions.</p>

                <h3>The Emperor's Executioner</h3>
                <p>Russ and his Legion earned a reputation as the Emperor's sanction against those who would break Imperial law. This role was demonstrated most notably in their actions against the Thousand Sons and in the lost Primarchs incident, though much of this history remains shrouded in mystery.</p>

                <h2>The Horus Heresy</h2>
                <h3>The Burning of Prospero</h3>
                <p>When ordered to bring Magnus the Red to Terra for his psychic transgressions, Russ was manipulated by Horus into attacking Prospero instead. The resulting conflict led to the destruction of the Thousand Sons' homeworld and their fall to Chaos, a decision that would have far-reaching consequences.</p>

                <h3>Path to Terra</h3>
                <p>After learning of Horus's treachery, Russ attempted to reach Terra but was delayed by numerous battles, including a significant confrontation with Horus himself that left both Primarchs grievously wounded. Though he eventually reached Terra, it was after the Emperor's internment on the Golden Throne.</p>

                <h2>Legacy</h2>
                <p>Leman Russ's influence continues through the Space Wolves Chapter, who maintain many of the traditions and practices he established. His disappearance into the Eye of Terror, promising to return for the final battle of the Wolftime, remains a central part of Space Wolf mythology.</p>
                <p>The Chapter maintains his teachings of independence and skepticism towards authority, while still remaining unquestionably loyal to the Emperor's ideals. His weapons and artifacts are carefully preserved as relics of immense spiritual significance to the Chapter.</p>
