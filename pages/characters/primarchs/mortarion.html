                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>Mortarion, known as the Death Lord, is the Primarch of the Death Guard Legion and now a Daemon Prince of Nurgle. Raised on the toxic world of Barbarus by a cruel xenos warlord, he developed an incredible resistance to toxins and a hatred for those who would oppress others. His eventual fall to Chaos came through bitter irony, as he and his Legion were forced to submit to Nurgle to survive the very poisons they had prided themselves on resisting.</p>
                <p>His transformation into a Daemon Prince marked a dark reflection of his past - becoming the very type of being he once fought against on Barbarus. Now he serves as one of Nurgle's greatest champions, spreading pestilence and decay across the galaxy.</p>

                <h2>Early Life</h2>
                <h3>Life on Barbarus</h3>
                <p>Landing on the death world of Barbarus, Mortarion was found and raised by one of the planet's overlords, powerful warlords who dwelt in keeps high above the toxic atmosphere where the human population struggled to survive. Despite being raised as the overlord's "son," Mortarion eventually discovered the truth about the oppression of humans below and turned against his adoptive father.</p>
                
                <h3>Liberation of Barbarus</h3>
                <p>Leading the humans of Barbarus, Mortarion waged a successful campaign against the overlords, developing weapons and strategies to fight in the toxic heights. However, his final confrontation with his adoptive father was interrupted by the Emperor's arrival, who completed the kill Mortarion could not make, a humiliation that would forever rankle the future Death Lord.</p>

                <h2>The Horus Heresy</h2>
                <h3>Path to Corruption</h3>
                <p>Mortarion's decision to join Horus came from a combination of factors: resentment towards the Emperor, a belief in Horus's vision of transhuman supremacy, and a deep-seated distrust of psykers and the Warp. However, his Legion's ultimate corruption by Nurgle came not through choice but necessity when they became trapped in the Warp.</p>

                <h3>Transformation</h3>
                <p>During their journey through the Warp to Terra, the Death Guard fleet became trapped by Nurgle's influence. As his Legion succumbed to a terrible plague, Mortarion was forced to pledge allegiance to Nurgle to save them, transforming both himself and his sons into plague marines. This marked their final, irrevocable fall to Chaos.</p>

            <section class="profile-section">
                <h2>Legacy</h2>
                <p>Mortarion's influence extends far beyond his original Legion. As a Daemon Prince of Nurgle, he has become one of the most powerful entities in the galaxy, leading vast armies of plague marines and daemons. His tactical expertise and understanding of biological warfare have made him a fearsome opponent of the Imperium.</p>
                <p>The bitter irony of his fate - becoming a powerful warp entity similar to the overlords he once fought against - serves as a dark reminder of the corrupting nature of Chaos. His Legion continues his legacy of resilience and inevitability, though now in service to decay and entropy rather than justice and liberation.</p>
