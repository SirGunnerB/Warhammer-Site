                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>Sanguinius, known as the Great Angel, was the Primarch of the Blood Angels Legion. Blessed with magnificent white wings and supernatural beauty, he was perhaps the most beloved of all the Emperor's sons. His noble spirit and sacrificial death at the hands of Horus during the Siege of Terra have made him one of the most revered figures in Imperial history.</p>
                <p>His genetic legacy lives on in his sons, the Blood Angels Chapter and their successors, though it is both a blessing and a curse, manifesting in the twin curses of the Red Thirst and the Black Rage.</p>

                <h2>Early Life</h2>
                <h3>Discovery on Baal</h3>
                <p>Like his brother Primarchs, Sanguinius was scattered across the galaxy by the Chaos Gods. He landed on the radiation-soaked moon of Baal Secundus, where he was found and raised by one of the few surviving human tribes, the Folk of Pure Blood, who recognized him as a blessed being despite his mutation - a pair of angel-like wings.</p>
                
                <h3>Rise to Leadership</h3>
                <p>Growing at an accelerated rate like all Primarchs, Sanguinius quickly became a leader among his people. He united the warring tribes of Baal Secundus and brought a measure of peace to the radiation-wastes, protecting his people from the mutants that roamed the desert.</p>

                <h2>Great Crusade</h2>
                <h3>Reunion with the Emperor</h3>
                <p>When the Emperor found Sanguinius, their meeting was one of immediate recognition and acceptance. Unlike some Primarchs who questioned or challenged their father, Sanguinius knelt immediately, pledging his eternal loyalty to the Emperor and his vision for humanity.</p>

                <h3>Leading the Blood Angels</h3>
                <p>Taking command of the IX Legion, Sanguinius transformed them into the Blood Angels, one of the most noble and accomplished Space Marine Legions. Under his leadership, they became renowned for both their martial prowess and their artistic sophistication.</p>

                <h2>The Horus Heresy</h2>
                <h3>Signus Prime</h3>
                <p>During the Heresy, Sanguinius and his Legion were lured to Signus Prime by Horus, where they faced a massive daemonic invasion. Despite terrible odds and corruption, they emerged victorious, though forever changed by the experience.</p>

                <h3>Defense of Terra</h3>
                <p>Sanguinius played a crucial role in the defense of Terra, commanding the forces defending the Emperor's Palace alongside Rogal Dorn. His final act was confronting Horus aboard his flagship, where he was slain in single combat, weakening Horus enough for the Emperor to eventually defeat him.</p>

                <h2>Legacy</h2>
                <p>Sanguinius's death left an indelible mark on the Imperium and his sons. The Blood Angels and their successor Chapters suffer from the Black Rage, a psychological affliction caused by the psychic imprint of their Primarch's death. Despite this curse, or perhaps because of it, they remain one of the most noble of all Space Marine Chapters.</p>
                <p>He is revered as a saint by the Imperial Cult, and his sacrifice is commemorated throughout the Imperium. The Sanguinala festival celebrates his memory and final sacrifice, second only to the Emperor in religious significance for many Imperial citizens.</p>
