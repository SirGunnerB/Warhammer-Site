                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>Horus was the first of the Emperor's Primarchs to be rediscovered and for many years was the most favored. As Warmaster, he led the Great Crusade at its height, commanding not just his own Legion but the entire military might of the Imperium. His fall to Chaos and subsequent rebellion against the Emperor became the most devastating conflict in human history, known as the Horus Heresy.</p>
                <p>His actions forever changed the Imperium, leading to the current state of the galaxy in the 41st Millennium. Even ten thousand years after his death, his name is synonymous with treachery and the dangers of pride and ambition.</p>

                <h2>Early Life</h2>
                <h3>Discovery</h3>
                <p>Horus was the first Primarch found by the Emperor, discovered on the gang-ruled mining world of Cthonia. Their relationship was uniquely close, with Horus spending many years as the Emperor's only found son, learning directly from his father and serving as both student and companion.</p>
                
                <h3>Rise to Leadership</h3>
                <p>Taking command of the XVI Legion, then known as the Luna Wolves, Horus quickly proved himself the most accomplished of the Primarchs in both warfare and diplomacy. His Legion's successes were unmatched, and he fostered close relationships with his brother Primarchs as they were discovered.</p>

                <h2>Great Crusade</h2>
                <h3>The Warmaster</h3>
                <p>Following the triumph at Ullanor, where he defeated the greatest Ork empire known to that time, Horus was elevated to the position of Warmaster. This made him supreme commander of all Imperial military forces, second only to the Emperor himself.</p>

                <h3>Leadership Style</h3>
                <p>Horus was known for his charisma and tactical brilliance. He preferred swift, decisive victories and often led from the front in his Legion's trademark "speartip" attacks. His diplomatic skills were equally renowned, often bringing worlds into compliance without bloodshed.</p>

                <h2>The Horus Heresy</h2>
                <h3>Fall to Chaos</h3>
                <p>Horus's fall began on the moon of Davin, where he was mortally wounded and healed in a Chaos ritual. This event, combined with his growing doubts about the Emperor's plans for the Imperium, led to his corruption by the Chaos Gods.</p>

                <h3>The Civil War</h3>
                <p>As Warmaster, Horus was able to turn nearly half of the Imperium's military forces to his cause. The civil war he ignited lasted seven years and culminated in the Siege of Terra, where he was finally defeated by the Emperor in single combat aboard his flagship.</p>

                <h2>Legacy</h2>
                <p>Horus's rebellion fundamentally changed the Imperium. His actions led to the Emperor's internment on the Golden Throne and the transformation of the Imperium into the religious, authoritarian state it became. His name became synonymous with treachery, and even ten thousand years later, speaking it is considered taboo in many parts of the Imperium.</p>
                <p>The Traitor Legions that followed him into damnation continue to wage the Long War against the Imperium from within the Eye of Terror, while his own Legion fractured into competing warbands after his death.</p>
