                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>Lion El'Jonson, Primarch of the Dark Angels, was one of the Emperor's most tactically brilliant sons. Found on the death world of Caliban, he was raised by the knightly Order and became its greatest champion. His strategic genius and unwavering loyalty to the Emperor made him one of the most accomplished Primarchs during the Great Crusade.</p>
                <p>Known for his secretive nature and complex personality, the Lion's legacy continues to influence the Dark Angels Chapter and their successors, particularly in their hunt for the Fallen Angels.</p>

                <h2>Early Life</h2>
                <h3>Discovery on Caliban</h3>
                <p>Landing in Caliban's monster-infested forests, the infant Primarch survived alone for years before being found by the Order, a brotherhood of knights. He was discovered by Luther, who would become his closest friend and mentor, and named after the mythical woodsman "Lion El'Jonson" - The Lion, Son of the Forest.</p>
                
                <h3>Rise in the Order</h3>
                <p>Growing quickly, the Lion became the Order's greatest warrior, leading campaigns to rid Caliban of its deadly Great Beasts. He united the planet's scattered knightly orders and modernized their society, preparing it for integration into the Imperium.</p>

                <h3>Leading the First Legion</h3>
                <p>Upon taking command of the Dark Angels, the Lion proved to be one of the Emperor's most effective commanders. His Legion's campaigns were marked by strategic brilliance and ruthless efficiency, particularly during the Rangdan Xenocides.</p>

                <h3>Military Philosophy</h3>
                <p>The Lion's approach to warfare combined knightly honor with cold pragmatism. He valued secrecy and self-reliance, traits that would become deeply ingrained in the Dark Angels' culture. His strategic genius was particularly evident in void warfare and large-scale campaigns.</p>

                <h2>The Horus Heresy</h2>
                <h3>Loyalty and Isolation</h3>
                <p>During the Heresy, the Lion's actions were characterized by strategic independence. While unquestionably loyal to the Emperor, his secretive nature and tendency to act alone led to some questioning his allegiance. He fought his own war against traitor forces, particularly during the Thramas Crusade against Konrad Curze.</p>

                <h3>The Fall of Caliban</h3>
                <p>Returning to Caliban after the Heresy, the Lion found his homeworld in rebellion under Luther. The ensuing conflict resulted in Caliban's destruction and the Lion's mysterious disappearance into the depths of The Rock, where he remains in stasis to this day.</p>

            <section class="profile-section">
                <h2>Legacy</h2>
                <p>The Lion's influence continues through the Dark Angels Chapter and their successors. His disappearance and the secrets surrounding the Fall of Caliban have shaped their culture into one of secrecy and relentless pursuit of redemption through hunting the Fallen Angels.</p>
                <p>His strategic doctrines and combat techniques remain core teachings within the Unforgiven Chapters, while his emphasis on self-reliance and secrecy has become a defining characteristic of their operations.</p>
