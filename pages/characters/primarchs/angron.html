                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>Angron, known as the Red Angel and the Lord of the Red Sands, is the Primarch of the World Eaters Legion and now a Daemon Prince of Khorne. His life has been defined by violence, rage, and an unquenchable thirst for vengeance. From his early days as a slave-gladiator to his current existence as a being of pure rage, Angron's story is one of tragedy and inevitable descent into madness.</p>
                <p>Recently returned to realspace in the 41st millennium, Angron has brought unprecedented bloodshed to the Imperium, leading devastating campaigns that have left entire sectors in ruins. His presence heralds apocalyptic violence and wholesale slaughter on a scale that even veteran Space Marines find difficult to comprehend.</p>

                <h2>Early Life</h2>
                <h3>The Gladiator King</h3>
                <p>Found on the world of Nuceria, Angron was enslaved and forced to fight in gladiatorial arenas from childhood. The implantation of the Butcher's Nails, archeotech devices that amplified aggression while suppressing all other emotions, transformed him into an unstoppable engine of destruction. Despite this, he maintained enough humanity to lead a slave uprising, forming deep bonds with his fellow gladiators.</p>
                
                <h3>The Emperor's Betrayal</h3>
                <p>When the Emperor arrived on Nuceria, instead of aiding Angron's rebellion, He teleported Angron away against his will, leaving his gladiator family to die. This betrayal would forever poison Angron's relationship with his father and the Imperium, setting him on a path of vengeance and destruction.</p>

                <h2>Great Crusade</h2>
                <h3>Leading the World Eaters</h3>
                <p>Taking command of the War Hounds Legion, renamed to World Eaters, Angron imposed the Butcher's Nails implantation on his sons despite the procedure's deadly nature. Under his leadership, the Legion degenerated into a force of unbridled violence, concerned only with close combat and killing.</p>

                <h3>Descent into Madness</h3>
                <p>The Butcher's Nails slowly destroyed Angron's mind, making him increasingly unstable and violent. Notable incidents like the Ghenna Massacre and the Night of the Wolf demonstrated his Legion's growing savagery and his own deteriorating mental state.</p>

                <h2>The Horus Heresy</h2>
                <h3>Joining the Rebellion</h3>
                <p>Angron readily joined Horus's rebellion, seeing it as an opportunity for revenge against the Emperor. During this period, he returned to Nuceria and learned the truth about his past, leading to the planet's destruction and his ascension to daemonhood.</p>

                <h3>Daemon Prince</h3>
                <p>Through the machinations of Lorgar, Angron was transformed into a Daemon Prince of Khorne during the Shadow Crusade. This transformation preserved his existence but eternally bound him to the Blood God's service.</p>

                <h2>Recent Events</h2>
                <h3>Return to Realspace</h3>
                <p>In the 41st millennium, Angron has returned to terrorize the Imperium. His most notable campaign was the Second Battle for Armatura, where he led a massive invasion force of World Eaters and daemons. This conflict demonstrated his enhanced powers as a Daemon Prince and his continued tactical acumen despite his all-consuming rage.</p>

                <h3>Current Activities</h3>
                <p>Angron continues to lead devastating raids from the Warp, each appearance marking a significant threat to Imperial worlds. His presence alone is enough to drive nearby humans into murderous frenzies, and his battles are marked by unprecedented levels of carnage.</p>

                <h3>The Nachmund Campaign</h3>
                <p>During the opening of the Great Rift, Angron led a devastating campaign through the Nachmund Gauntlet, one of the few stable passages through the rift. His forces laid waste to multiple Imperial worlds, culminating in a massive confrontation with Grey Knights and Custodian forces.</p>

                <h3>Transformation</h3>
                <p>Recent encounters suggest Angron's form has evolved further, becoming even more monstrous. Imperial reports describe him as a towering entity of brass and blood, his daemon form incorporating elements of ancient gladiatorial armor fused with daemonic flesh.</p>

                <h3>Black Blade</h3>
                <p>Angron's massive chainaxe, forged from unknown materials that could withstand his incredible strength. The weapon's teeth were said to be crafted from the crystallized blood of his fallen gladiator brothers.</p>
