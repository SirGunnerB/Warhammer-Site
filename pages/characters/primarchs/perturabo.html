                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>Perturabo, known as the Lord of Iron, was the Primarch of the Iron Warriors Legion. A genius in siege warfare and technology, he was cursed with the ability to see the flaws in everything, from architecture to human nature. His bitterness at being used as the Emperor's siege specialist, combined with his rivalry with Rogal Dorn and the thankless tasks assigned to his Legion, eventually led him to side with Horus during the Heresy.</p>
                <p>Despite his immense talents in engineering, architecture, and military strategy, Perturabo's story is one of tragedy born from perceived slights and an inability to escape his role as the Emperor's breaker of walls. His fall to Chaos was as much a product of his own inner demons as it was external circumstances.</p>

                <h2>Early Life</h2>
                <h3>Life on Olympia</h3>
                <p>Found on the mountainous world of Olympia, Perturabo was adopted by its ruler, Dammekos. From the moment of his discovery, he displayed an incredible intellect, able to understand complex mathematics and engineering principles without being taught. He could see the underlying patterns in everything, a gift that would become both blessing and curse.</p>
                
                <h3>Rise to Power</h3>
                <p>Perturabo quickly became essential to Olympia's development, designing grand works of architecture and advancing the planet's technology. However, his relationship with his adoptive father was strained, and he felt more like a tool than a son. This pattern of being valued for his utility rather than himself would repeat throughout his life.</p>

                <h2>Great Crusade</h2>
                <h3>Leading the Iron Warriors</h3>
                <p>Taking command of the IV Legion, Perturabo reorganized them into a highly efficient siege warfare force. The Iron Warriors became known for their ability to break any fortress and endure any hardship. However, they were often assigned to the most grueling siege warfare and garrison duty, earning little recognition for their sacrifices.</p>

                <h3>The Bitter Road</h3>
                <p>The Iron Warriors' role as siege specialists and garrison troops led to them being spread thin across the Imperium, manning countless thankless posts while other Legions won glory in more prestigious campaigns. This, combined with Perturabo's growing resentment of Rogal Dorn's favored status, planted the seeds of betrayal.</p>

                <h2>The Horus Heresy</h2>
                <h3>Path to Betrayal</h3>
                <p>The breaking point came when Perturabo returned to Olympia to find it in rebellion. His response was characteristically brutal - the complete destruction of his homeworld. This act of genocide, combined with his existing grievances, made him receptive to Horus's offer of allegiance.</p>

                <h3>Siege Master</h3>
                <p>During the Heresy, Perturabo's expertise in siege warfare proved invaluable to Horus's forces. He masterminded numerous campaigns, including the infamous Siege of Terra, where his knowledge of Imperial fortifications and siege craft nearly brought victory to the traitor forces.</p>

                <h2>Legacy</h2>
                <p>Perturabo's influence on warfare and fortification endures in both loyal and traitor forces. His siege techniques are still studied, though few know their origin, and his innovations in warfare continue to shape military doctrine.</p>
                <p>As a Daemon Prince, he rules over Medrengard, a daemon world that reflects his obsession with fortification and siege warfare. His Legion continues his methods of warfare, though they've become as cold and ruthless as their Primarch, viewing war as a mathematical equation to be solved rather than a noble endeavor.</p>
