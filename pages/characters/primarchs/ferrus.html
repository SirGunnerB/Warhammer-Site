                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>Ferrus Manus, also known as The Gorgon, was the Primarch of the Iron Hands Legion. A master craftsman and warrior, he was renowned for his incredible strength and his silver metallic hands - a gift from his victory over a necrodermis dragon on Medusa. His philosophy of strength and the elimination of weakness would shape his Legion's culture for millennia to come.</p>
                <p>His death at the hands of his closest brother Fulgrim during the Dropsite Massacre on Isstvan V marked one of the first and most tragic casualties of the Horus Heresy, fundamentally changing the Iron Hands Legion and their approach to warfare and humanity.</p>

                <h2>Early Life</h2>
                <h3>Life on Medusa</h3>
                <p>Landing on the harsh world of Medusa, Ferrus Manus quickly adapted to its unforgiving environment. He wandered the planet's surface, testing himself against its dangers and forging his legend among its people. His most famous early deed was his battle with the C'tan shard known as the Silver Dragon, which resulted in his hands being coated in living metal.</p>
                
                <h3>Rise to Power</h3>
                <p>Unlike many of his brothers who became rulers of their adoptive worlds, Ferrus Manus never sought to unite or rule Medusa. Instead, he spent his time crafting magnificent weapons and items in the great forges, pushing himself to master every aspect of creation and destruction. His works became legendary among the clans of Medusa, though he often destroyed his creations, believing the act of creation more important than the finished product.</p>

                <h2>Great Crusade</h2>
                <h3>Leading the Iron Hands</h3>
                <p>When reunited with the Emperor, Ferrus Manus took command of the X Legion, renamed the Iron Hands. Under his leadership, the Legion became known for their ruthless efficiency and technological mastery. They fought countless campaigns during the Great Crusade, earning a reputation for both their martial prowess and their disdain for weakness.</p>

                <h3>Brotherhood with Fulgrim</h3>
                <p>During the Great Crusade, Ferrus formed a close brotherhood with Fulgrim of the Emperor's Children. The two Primarchs shared a passion for perfection and craftsmanship, though they expressed it differently. Their friendship would make Fulgrim's later betrayal and their final confrontation all the more tragic.</p>

                <h2>The Horus Heresy</h2>
                <h3>Path to Isstvan</h3>
                <p>When news of Horus's betrayal reached him, Ferrus Manus was one of the first to advocate immediate action against the traitors. His close friendship with Fulgrim led him to believe he could turn his brother back to loyalty, a belief that would prove fatal.</p>

                <h3>The Drop Site Massacre</h3>
                <p>At Isstvan V, Ferrus led the first wave of loyalist forces against the traitors. In the midst of battle, he confronted Fulgrim in personal combat. Despite his tremendous strength and skill, he was ultimately defeated and killed by his former brother, marking one of the first and most significant casualties of the Heresy.</p>

                <h2>Legacy</h2>
                <p>Ferrus Manus's death had a profound impact on both the Imperium and his Legion. The Iron Hands became even more devoted to the elimination of weakness, interpreting their Primarch's teachings in an increasingly extreme way. They began replacing their flesh with machinery, seeing human weakness as the cause of their father's death.</p>
                <p>His philosophy of strength and the persecution of weakness continues to influence the Iron Hands Chapter to the present day, though some argue they have misinterpreted his true teachings. His death serves as a constant reminder of the cost of the Horus Heresy and the betrayal that split the Imperium.</p>
