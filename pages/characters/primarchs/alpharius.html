                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>Alpharius and Omegon were unique among the Primarchs, being twins who shared a single Legion. Their very existence as twins was one of the most closely guarded secrets of the Imperium, with even their brother Primarchs unaware of Omegon's existence. Masters of subterfuge and deception, their true loyalties and current status remain one of the greatest mysteries of the Horus Heresy.</p>
                <p>In the 41st millennium, the Alpha Legion continues to operate in cells across the galaxy, and reports of Alpharius or Omegon leading operations persist, though the truth of these claims remains impossible to verify.</p>

                <h2>Early Life</h2>
                <h3>The Twin Primarchs</h3>
                <p>Unlike their brother Primarchs, Alpharius and Omegon's early history remains largely unknown, possibly even to themselves. Their unique nature as twins may have been an intentional creation by the Emperor, or an unexpected outcome of the Primarch Project. What is known is that they operated in perfect synchronization from the moment of their discovery.</p>
                
                <h3>Discovery</h3>
                <p>Officially, Alpharius was the last Primarch to be discovered, though accounts of his finding vary wildly and may be intentionally misleading. Some sources suggest he was discovered by Horus himself, while others indicate he may have been operating within the Imperium long before his "official" discovery.</p>

                <h2>Great Crusade</h2>
                <h3>Leading the Alpha Legion</h3>
                <p>Under their leadership, the Alpha Legion developed unprecedented expertise in covert operations, infiltration, and psychological warfare. Their methods often drew criticism from other Legions, but their effectiveness was undeniable. The twins' ability to seamlessly switch roles and maintain multiple concurrent operations became legendary.</p>

                <h3>Methods and Philosophy</h3>
                <p>The Alpha Legion's approach to warfare emphasized intelligence gathering, infiltration, and the manipulation of enemy forces. They frequently employed human operatives and complex networks of agents, demonstrating a unique appreciation for baseline humanity among the Legions.</p>

                <h2>The Horus Heresy</h2>
                <h3>The Cabal's Influence</h3>
                <p>Their involvement with the mysterious xenos organization known as the Cabal proved pivotal in their decision to seemingly support Horus. The Cabal presented them with a vision of two possible futures: the Emperor's victory leading to ten thousand years of stagnation, or Horus's victory causing humanity's extinction and denying Chaos its power source.</p>

                <h3>Complex Loyalties</h3>
                <p>Evidence suggests the twins may have worked toward different goals during the Heresy, with some sources indicating Omegon may have secretly supported the Emperor while Alpharius followed the Cabal's plan. Their true motivations and actions during this period remain debated by Imperial scholars.</p>

                <h2>Post-Heresy</h2>
                <h3>Conflicting Reports</h3>
                <p>Alpharius was reportedly killed by Rogal Dorn during the Battle of Pluto, though given the Legion's predilection for deception, this remains uncertain. Omegon's fate is entirely unknown, with some suggesting he assumed the identity of Alpharius after his brother's death.</p>

                <h3>Legacy of Deception</h3>
                <p>The Alpha Legion continues to operate in the 41st millennium, maintaining their founders' traditions of subterfuge and multiple, concurrent operations. Their true allegiance remains unclear, with different cells seemingly working both for and against Imperial interests.</p>
